One major way inheritance is used is that it helps with reusability in programs, such that if you know multiple classes do similar things, just having one inherit the other helps make functions and actions easier to reuse.
The other major way is its help in object based programming, such that of using is-a relationships, for which if you have multiple objects that share some common value, such as both boats and cars being vehicles, you can use inheritance to connect it to a parent vehicle class to have shared functions, such as a constructor, perhaps for how many wheels it has, while also having their own functions, like drive with a car or propel in a boat.
